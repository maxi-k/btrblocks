## Usage

After [building](#building) the library, follow one of the [examples](./tools/examples) to get started.

## Components

- `btrblocks/`: the compression library, schemes, utilities, ...
- `btrfiles/`: helper library for binary files and yaml schema information
- `tools/`: various conversion, measurement and benchmarking tools
- `test/`: rudimentary tests for the library

## Building

We currently require an x86 platform.
This library was built and tested on linux only.

``` sh
mkdir build 
cd build
cmake ..
```

Then, depending on your usecase, build only the library or any of the tools:
- build everything: `make`
- install static library and headers on your system: `sudo make install`
- build the compression library only: `make btrblocks`
- build the tests `make tester`
- build the in-memory decompression speed benchmark: `make decompression_speed`
- ...

For a list of all valid targets, run `make help`.

Library was built and tested on Linux (x86, ARM) and MacOS (ARM).
